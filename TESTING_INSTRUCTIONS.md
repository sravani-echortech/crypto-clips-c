# Testing Google OAuth in Expo Go - Fixed

## What Was Fixed

1. **OAuth Redirect Loop** - Fixed by removing the redirect URL for Expo Go
2. **Session Not Being Created** - Added polling mechanism to check for session after OAuth
3. **React Hooks Error** - Fixed incorrect usage of `useAuth()` inside a function

## Testing Steps

### 1. Clean Start
```bash
# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start -c
```

### 2. On Your Mobile Device
- Force close Expo Go app
- Clear browser cookies (Chrome/Safari)
- Reopen Expo Go and scan QR code

### 3. Sign In Process
1. Tap "Sign in with Google"
2. Browser will open
3. Complete Google sign-in
4. You'll see a success page
5. **Return to the Expo Go app** (don't close browser, just switch apps)
6. Wait a few seconds - the app will detect the session
7. You'll be logged in!

## Expected Logs

You should see:
```
LOG  üöÄ Starting Google OAuth with Supabase...
LOG  üì± Generated redirect URL: exp://192.168.0.223:8082/--/auth/callback
LOG  üìç Generated URL: exp://192.168.0.223:8082/--/auth/callback

LOG  üì± Running in Expo Go - using web browser flow

LOG  üëÜ Please complete sign-in in the browser and return to the app
LOG  ‚úÖ Session found after OAuth!
LOG  ‚úÖ User authenticated: your-email@gmail.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Looping
1. Check Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
2. Ensure Site URL is: `http://localhost:19006`
3. Clear all browser data and try again

### If Session Not Found
1. Complete sign-in in browser
2. **Return to Expo Go app** (don't close browser)
3. Wait up to 60 seconds for session detection
4. Check console logs for errors

### If Hooks Error Persists
1. Restart Expo with `npx expo start -c`
2. The error should be gone now

## Alternative: Development Build

For the best experience, create a development build:
```bash
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android
```

This will give you:
- Proper deep linking
- No manual browser switching
- Seamless OAuth flow

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

1. **Expo Go Limitation**: Can't handle custom URL schemes (cryptoclips://)
2. **Workaround**: Opens browser, polls for session after auth
3. **Session Detection**: Checks every 2 seconds for up to 60 seconds
4. **Auto Login**: Once session is found, you're logged in

The authentication now works in Expo Go with this polling workaround!
